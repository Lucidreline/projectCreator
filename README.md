A Yython automation app that gets you started with your project. For windows. Not sure how this will work on Mac.

And also install Chrome Driver. Then put chrome driver in a folder, copy the path to that folder, and add that path as the value of the environmental system variable 'path'

##Usage
Open up app.py and enter your github username and password on lines 8 and 9.

Change 11 line to the path where you want to create your new folder

To create a project, open your terminal and change dir into this folder. Then, run the python script along with your project's name
